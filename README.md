# revium

## Get Started
- run `npm run serve`

## Features if I had more time
- import sass variables from `src/assets/styles/_variables.scss` globally
- either setup an RxJS observable for sharing data between components or use vue's event bus concept (the use case would be for the burger menu trigger in this particular instrance)
- optimise the carousel and images.
- design the mobile menu better

## Time Taken
- 2.5 hours
